Week 1: Our discussions have been around making minimalistic features, so that we learn and master the core features 
before going fancy and add additional features (if time permits). For instance, when we were discussing the flow of the 
sequence, we were brainstorming around how we'll know if all the products in the cart at a particular time is the final order.
Should we notify everyone that we are placing the order and give them a way for them to validate if it is indeed their 
final order? Receiving validation from everyone who has access to the  cart is an overhead. Instead we decided to send out 
a group notification at the time of creation of the cart and simply place a timer on the cart visible to everyone,
after which order will be final. Simple and efficient.

Week 2: While discussing the use case flow we came across the situation about what the user will see in the cart when he opens it, 
the entire order for everyone or just what he has ordered. For simplicity's sake we decided that the user views only what he orders 
so he can only see and alter what he has ordered and not mess with the entire order.

Week 3:
While designing our databases and use cases we took care of avoiding redundant cases and attributes. This will help us maintain integrity of 
the data in the future.

Week 4: 
We decided to limit the number of options on the menu so that they all fit on the same screen and the focus can be maintained on the 
core functionalities and not concern ourselves with alignment, etc problems on the UI.

Week 5:
We decided to create a master-test branch to integrate all our changes and test before we send it to the main master branch.

Week 6:
We decided to integrate all the code written so far so that future development can be syncronized.
