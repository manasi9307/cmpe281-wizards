#### XP Core Value: Eliminating Waste

Week 1 : Eliminating waste acts as a key item for the success of a project and plays a crucial role in completion of a project within the given time frame. In every team meeting, team members come up with various approaches to build the product and solve a problem. Eliminating waste comes in play when we have to determine if an action taken by the team adds up to the common goal of success of the project or not. We have to decide if we are putting efforts towards a single objective and not diverging from the correct path.

Week 2 : We invested this week in deciding the initial design for our database for the applications. There were many situations where we were going towards a path of creating redundant fields related to different applications. The "Eliminating Waste" factor was of great help in such situations. We recognized the redundancy points and improved upon our design which in turn helped in reducing the complexity of our project.

Week 3 : This week was invested in designing the initial draft database using MongoDb and creating an outline of the database we are going to use in the application. We used the "Eliminating waste" value to identify the particular fields which we were resuing in the initial design and the fields which could be calcualated using the existing data fields. Doing this helped us to siplify the database and helped us to avoid the complicated implementation issues which we could have faced in future.

Week 4 : This week we faced many scenarious while creating the UI wireframe and our individually owned databases, where we were doing overlap on various fields of the databases. We identified those points and worked upon it in order to simplify the database design. We also used the "Eliminating waste" value while coming up with the initial class diagram for designing the databases.

Week 5 : This week the team with started with setting up MongoDb databases on AWS EC2 instance and coding part for the individual applications. We extensively used "Eliminating waste" value this week for creating the design of our code. There were many instances where we were facing an overlap of functionalities in our design. We rectified those and resolved them so that the coding tasks are executed smoothly and we avoid redundant code in our codebase.

Week 6 : This week involved coding our data domains on our personal branches. We had decided to test the code locally first and then push it to our EC2 instances. While coming up with the code at the starting of our week, we recognized that we are coding various data domain functionlities in multiple apps. We then came up with a design where this redundancy was resolved and our efforts were saved. This is how "Eliminating waste" value was utilized this week.
