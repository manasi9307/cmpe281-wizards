# Team Meetings

#### Date: 09-20-2017  

Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes 

Noted by: Manasi Thakur

Agenda:
Discuss about the flow and design of the project

Outcome:
* Brainstormed about the technology stack to be used.
* Database and UI design to be implemented
* Various permutation and combination of user stories.
* Created a backlog of the research topics


#### What did the team do the past week? 
The team was researching upon the initial design of the project. We were coming up with ideas about how to approach the project and what particular technologies to be used in the project. We came up with various permutations and combinations of working on the project from various angles. The key questions on which we were brainstorming were:
- How to implement the project 
- The applications each member will design.
- Core values each member will own.
- Data domains each member will work on


#### What is the team going to do next week?

As we have created a draft outline of the project, the next step for the team is going to be the design part. We would have to finalize on the following points: 
- Front end design i.e. how the web page is going to be presented to the user. 
- How many web pages we need to design for the complete application
- How the various data domains are going to get linked to the front end application
- Once we have finalized on the above three requirements, we would start with the front end coding part

#### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?

We are currently working primarily on the initial design part. Our major challenges are to come up with a proper flow for the project in which way we are going to present the product to our end user. Another challenge we are facing is to identify the skill gap among our team and how to bridge that. So in the coming week, we would try to identify what technologies we need learn in order to make the coding part of the project as smooth as possible.

# Team Meetings

#### Date: 09-28-2017  

Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes 

Noted by: Varun Upadhyay

Agenda:
Discuss about the database design for the project

Outcome:
* Discussed about the draft version of the database which we will implement for the project.
* Brainstormed through various combinations for database design and came up with a final version
* Decided to come up with an initial implementation of databases for all applications along with an ER diagram

#### What did the team do the past week? 
The team came up with an initial design for a multi-user food ordering application. We decided on the end to end workflow of the application and worked on the research topics which were the major blockers we were facing while working on the project.


#### What is the team going to do next week?

We have discussed about the draft version of the database we are going to use for the project. Our major goals for this week would comprise of the following:
- Come up with a draft implementation of databases for all the applications using MongoDB
- Create an ER diagram to show a clear relationship among various applications of our project

#### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?

The challenge which we are facing for this week is to get comfortable while working on the MongoDB database. We would be putting efforts towards getting familiar with the MongoDB database and at the same time we would start with the initial design of the database.

# Team Meetings

#### Date: 10-03-2017  


#### What did the team do the past week? 
Created an ER diagram to show a clear relationship among various applications of our project. Created a use case diagram for represenatation of user case flows. Created UI wireframes for individual screens. We also came up with the initial design of our individually owned databases.


#### What is the team going to do next week?

We plan to publish our MongoDB databases. Also, research on how to deploy and connect our individual datbases in AWS.

#### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?

The challenge we are facing this week is figuring out how our databases will talk to each other.
